A robust solution involves avoiding the `!important` flag whenever possible and carefully considering CSS specificity:

1. **Avoid `!important`:**  Rewriting your CSS to avoid the need for `!important` is generally best practice. This often requires a deeper understanding of CSS specificity and selector optimization.

2. **Increase Specificity:** Instead of relying on `!important`, create more specific selectors that take precedence naturally.  If the `p` tag within `.element` truly needs a different font size, you may consider:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.element {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.element p {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

3. **CSS Preprocessor:**  Use a CSS preprocessor (like Sass or Less) to manage your CSS better, making it easier to organize, maintain, and prevent unnecessary specificity issues.
