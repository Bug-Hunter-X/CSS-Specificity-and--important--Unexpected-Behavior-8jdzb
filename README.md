# CSS Specificity and !important: An Uncommon Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet potentially problematic behavior related to CSS specificity and the `!important` flag.  While `!important` generally overrides other styles, inconsistencies can arise in certain scenarios, primarily involving complex selectors or browser-specific interpretations.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential solution by restructuring selectors to avoid unnecessary use of `!important` and leveraging more specific selectors, depending on the desired outcome.

This issue is less common than typical CSS bugs but is worth understanding to avoid unexpected layout issues in complex projects.
