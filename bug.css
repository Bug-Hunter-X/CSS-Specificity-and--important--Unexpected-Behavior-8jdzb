The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.element {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.element p {
  font-size: 14px !important;
}
```

The `!important` flag on `.element p` overrides the inheritance from `.element` and the declaration on `.container`. However, in certain situations, even with `!important`, unexpected behavior may arise due to browser-specific handling of specificity, especially when dealing with deeply nested elements or complex selectors.
